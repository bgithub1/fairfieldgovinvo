## Town of Fairfield tabular info 
##### (work in progress)

This repo will eventually contain tabular information about local government in Fairfield, CT. For example, the `rtm.ipynb` notebook lists the current members of the **Representative Town Meeting**, showing each memebers district, position (if any), name and party affiliation.  It also shows some simple aggregates such as the current distribution of members by party.  

In the future, I hope to add more notebooks and tables (csv files) that help analyze town government.
